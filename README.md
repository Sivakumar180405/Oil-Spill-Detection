# Oil-Spill-Detection
Proposed a solution to detect oil spills or any distress in vessels  in the marine environment by monitoring their behaviour  continuously for any anomalies using the Isolation Forest ML  algorithm in conjunction with APIs from AIS and satellites. 
This was a group project that me and my team worked in for Smart India Hackathon 2024.
I had worked in this project during my Third year of my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
